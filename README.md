# Projectile-Launcher

Part of our class-sized marble maze for Advanced Robotics. It just shoots the marble across the room at a target. We worked in a
group of 4 people and all contributed to the physical design and testing of the machine. However, I wrote and tested the entirety of the code.
Built on the Vex V5 platform.
